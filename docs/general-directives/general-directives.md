# General Directives
The following points provide a brief overview of the expectations within the Foundation, however, they should not be used as your sole source of information when it comes to Foundation guidelines. It is still expected that you read the entirety of this website.

- Any attempt, successful or not, to bribe members to gain perks or benefits of any sort through monetary or other means of rewards should be reported to the Ethics Committee.
- Systems within Foundation facilities such as radios and terminals may only be used with competency, maturity, efficiency, and only for their intended purpose(s).
- To enhance organisation, efficiency and to prevent flooding, members may only request Class D if the requester is within the destined Test Subject Transfer Area.
- While ambition is a favourable trait, members who are overly ambitious and/or greedy will not be favoured for promotions as much in comparison to hard-working and humble members.
- While members may minorly aid other members with their applications, helping too much or giving away answers (and consequently, encouraging such behaviour) is not permitted. Guiding someone to the location of answers (e.g. the SCP Wiki) is allowed.
- Members may not be both within the Foundation and in a recognised hostile group unless acting on behalf of the Foundation's responsibilities, or are within a position of non-active involvement (e.g. development, group holder, entry rank).
- In scenarios where guidelines are not comprehensive enough, a violation of expected behaviour may still warrant disciplinary action. Some examples include: setting a bad precedent, or the creation of mistrust. Punishments can only be issued by members who are Level 4 or above and the action taken must be heavily justified.
