# Paging
## What is paging?
There is the ability, on-site, to request backup from the Mobile Task Forces in scenarios where extra forces or assistance is required. Upon submitting a page request, the provided task force will be notified within their designated Discord server, informing them to attend on-site to the situation at hand.

## How do I page?
In order to page a task force, head to a terminal's command line view, and enter the following command (replacing parameters accordingly).

```
page <task force> <reason>
```

- **Task Force** - The task force name to notify. The possible options for this parameter are as follows, each with a set of responsibilities.
    - **BETA** - Handles containment and assisting with the testing of more dangerous SCPs.
    - **SIGMA** - Handles extreme combat, riots and tactical operations.
- **Reason** - A short and concise brief as to why you're paging this task force.

An example page command would look like the following.

```
page SIGMA Large scale TSC riot.
```

## Who can page?
Class C members of the Foundation are able to use the paging functionality.

## Are there paging rules?
Yes, there are paging rules. These are detailed below.

- Use only for significant scenarios where a task force is truly required.
- Keep paging reasons short and concise, explaining the scenario at hand.
- Per task force, a page can only be sent once every 30 minutes across the entire server. Think wisely and prioritise scenarios of higher significance.

Failure to abide by the above expectations will result in disciplinary action.
