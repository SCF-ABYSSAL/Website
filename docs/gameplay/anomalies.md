# Anomalies
Anomalies are also known as an “SCP” or “entity”. These are beings that have the ability to be tested on to discover effects which it may have on a player (usually Class D). Our primary facility (Area-14) houses many SCPs with each being assigned a classification (“SCP Classification”) based on how much they pose a risk to the Foundation and its members.

## SCP Classifications
### Safe
SCPs that have an assigned SCP classification of “Safe” are anomalies, as the title suggests, safe. They can be easily tested on and safely contained with absolute minimal risk to the Foundation and its members.

### Euclid
SCPs that have an assigned SCP classification of “Euclid” pose a mediocre risk to the Foundation and its members. This is usually due to the fact these SCPs are insufficiently understood and require more research. Containment may be a hassle in the event of a breach.

### Keter
SCPs that have an assigned SCP classification of “Keter” are a high risk to the Foundation and its members. These anomalies are extremely dangerous and great care is required during testing. Containment of these SCPs usually requires multiple members due to their unpredictable and hostile behaviour.

### What does termination criteria mean?
Termination criteria details under which cases it is allowed to terminate Class D members, and cases where it is not. This is to ensure gameplay remains fair and enjoyable for both members of the Foundation and Class D members.

Failure to abide by the outlined criteria will result in disciplinary action being taken by the Ethics Committee.
