# Site Protocols
All Foundation personnel holding a security clearance of at least Level 0 are expected to be aware of all global site protocols and respond to them accordingly as soon as they are declared by an authorised authority.

## Fade Out (Code Blue)
There is not any unorthodox situation that requires a response by the Foundation, nor is there an immediate risk of one occurring. All Foundation personnel and departments are to resume their day-to-day activities.

## White Drop (Code Green)
There is a possibility of a containment breach. Mobile Task Forces personnel are to verify the containment status of all anomalies. Normal activities may continue, although all personnel must stay alert should a containment breach be confirmed. Ensure to report any suspicious anomalous activity found.

## Dog Track (Code Yellow)
There is a very high possibility of a containment breach. Mobile Task Forces personnel are to focus on minimizing such danger while all other personnel take the necessary precautions in case it takes place.

## Red Fox (Code Red)
A containment breach has occurred, therefore Security personnel are to escort all non-combative personnel to a Breach Shelter.

While D/E Class personnel must remain within the Test Subject Containment Area, those who were not within it (in most cases, due to them partaking in scientific research at the time) may accompany their testers and escorts to a Breach Shelter - although non-compliance is to be punished with termination.

Mobile Task Forces personnel are to contain or neutralize the breached SCPs as soon as possible, terminating anyone who obstructs the containment/neutralization process and holds a security clearance below Level 4.

## Blackout (Code White)
A large amount of threats to the site’s security (either anomalous, hostile test subjects, or both) have been reported. The site’s lighting system is to be shut off and all combative personnel are to address the threat appropriately, while non-combative personnel should either remain in their current location or evacuate to an appropriate safe room.

## Defence (Code Grey)
The facility is undergoing an unauthorized attack by several rogue personnel, test subjects, or a hostile force. All combative personnel are to neutralize the threats and protect the site’s security, while non-combative personnel must report to their designated spawn area to avoid interaction with persons who pose a threat.

## Knife Cut (Code Purple)
A hostile party has begun an authorized raid on the facility. Combative personnel are to respond appropriately while non-combative personnel must evacuate to the breach shelter. The Department of External Affairs is to moderate the raid according to the guidelines in effect at the time.

## Hazard (Code Pink)
An exploiter has been sighted. When this protocol is sounded, it is imperative that personnel attempt to gain and forward evidence of the exploiter to any available Level 4+ without breaking any regulations, such as following an exploiter into Containment Zones when you lack the clearance to be there. If evidence cannot be produced due to special circumstances, a Level 4 or higher may be requested to come on-site to handle the issue themselves.
