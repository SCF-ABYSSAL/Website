# Observation Privileges
## What are observation privileges?
Observation privileges, as the title suggests, is the privilege to observe an activity that takes place on-site. Naturally, not everyone is given the privilege to observe activities to ensure the operational integrity of the site. There are cases however where the ability to observe an activity is allowed; these will be detailed below section.

## What type of activities can be observed?
### Class D Questionings
#### Description
These are sessions hosted by the Ethics Committee to gain an understanding of how Class D is currently being treated, answer any questions they may have, and gather their opinions of the Foundation.

#### Spectator Requirements
- Must be at least Level 0.

### Medical Checkups
#### Description
Checkups are hosted by the Medical Department in order to ensure the health of members of the Foundation is up-to-scratch. In order to ensure so, their patient will be asked to complete a series of tests and/or questions. If determined by the host, treatment may be administered.

#### Spectator Requirements
- Must be at least Level 1, or be a Department of External Affairs Associate representing an allied group.
- No more than 3 spectators are allowed.

### Research Tests
#### Description
In order to conduct research on anomalies in Foundation facilities, a “Research Test” is conducted. Depending on whether the Scientific Department or Medical Department is hosting the research test, the goals will be different, although ultimately it comes to research.

For the Scientific Department, the goal is to gain an understanding of an SCP itself, whereas, for the Medical Department, the goal is to gain an understanding of the effects of an SCP when a patient has administered effects.

#### Spectator Requirements
- Scientific Department members may spectate research tests under the assumption that the member in question is normally allowed to research test on (including those which require supervision) the SCP.
- Members who are at least Level 2, or Associates representing an allied group, may spectate research tests within the Light Containment Zone.
- Members who are at least Level 3 may spectate research tests within the Moderate Containment Zone (unless the said research test is deemed too dangerous by the Mobile Task Forces or Security Department).
- No more than 2 spectators are allowed.
- Spectators must remain three meters from the containment door and any viewing windows.

### External Research Tests
#### Description
From time to time, members from other approved Foundations may wish to conduct a Research Test within our facility.

External Research Tests hold the same intention as regular Research Tests, although are subject to additional spectator requirements as set out below.

#### Spectator Requirements
- By default, External Research Tests hold the same spectator requirements of regular Research Tests.
- One member part of the Department of External Affairs may spectate and also be excluded from any spectator limits. They should not be counted in any spectator limits for other wishing-spectator members.

## What are the spectator rules?
Spectators must not do any of the following.

- Interact/join in with the activity.
- Cause disruption.

Any members who are in violation of these rules after warnings or other criteria outlined within this section are to be reported to the Ethics Committee.

## Do I have to request permission to spectate an activity?
Yes, permission is required from the host of the activity unless you are part of their department High Command or are exempt from spectator limits (although the criteria within this article must still be followed).

It is at the host’s discretion if they’d like to accept or decline requests to spectate their activity.

## Are there any spectator priorities?
- Class C members and Department of External Affairs Associates representing an allied group have priority over Class B members.
- Financial Staff has priority over Class C and Class B members.
- One Ethics Committee member wishing to spectate is exempt from spectator limits, and they should not be counted in any spectator limits for other wishing-spectator members unless the activity is taking place in the Heavy Containment Zone. Other wishing-spectators who are part of the Ethics Committee are to be treated as having Class B priority.
- Manufacturing Department members may spectate any activity within their clearance (or up to Level 4 clearance if approved by a Senior Developer or above). These members are exempt from spectator limits, and themselves should not be counted in any spectator limits for other wishing-spectator members.
- Members who are at least Level 4 may spectate any activity they wish. These members are exempt from spectator limits, and themselves should not be counted in any spectator limits for other wishing-spectator members.

## What if the spectator limit has been reached?
When the spectator limit has been reached, no more members are authorised to spectate (unless otherwise stated in this article). This to ensure the integrity of the activity and to minimise any possible disruptions.

If all members have the same spectator priority, then it is up to the discretion of the host of who they’d like to spectate.

When it comes to a member who has priority wanting to spectate, they may only spectate under the following conditions.

- If the activity is starting up, then the member who has priority must be allowed to spectate. A member who has a lower priority will need to be dismissed from spectating.
- If the activity is already in session, then unless a current spectator is willing to swiftly switch (at their own discretion) with the wishing-spectator who has priority, the wishing-spectator must leave the activity.
