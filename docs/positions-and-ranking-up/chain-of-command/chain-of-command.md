# Chain of Command
In order to ensure efficient communications between security clearances are maintained, a chain of command is employed and must be followed. Failure in compliance will result in disciplinary action being taken by the appropriate authorities within the Foundation.

The chain of command is as follows, in ascending order.

- Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 Members
- Foundation Medium Command
- Foundation High Command
- Overwatch Command
- Overseer Council

The chain of command’s purpose is to clarify who is the direct superior of who, and therefore who is in charge of them.

*An example usage of the chain of command would be a Level 2 who has a query. As the Foundation’s Medium Command (Level 3) are their direct superior, they should first contact them before going further another layer (for instance, the Foundation’s High Command (Level 4)).*

There are exceptions to the chain of command, however. In a scenario where it is absolutely known a layer is unable to handle a query, then intermediary layers may be skipped and instead the intended layer may be contacted.

*An example scenario where a layer of the chain of command may be skipped is in regards to applications. If it has been more than 48 hours and a Class D’s Level 0 application has not been read, they can contact a member of the Foundation’s Medium Command (Level 3) directly.*

{: .information }
The chain of command does not mean only direct superiors have authority over others. **Any** higher layer still has authority over **any** lower layer.
