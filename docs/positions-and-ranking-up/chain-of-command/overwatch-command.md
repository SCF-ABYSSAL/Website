# Overwatch Command
Here at the Foundation, we have two types of Site Directors, each differing from one another. Both the Site Director and the Technical Site Director are considered Level 4, although are part of the Overwatch Command, which in turn works directly below the O5 Council. The term "Overwatch Command" is simply a way to refer to both types of Site Director.

## Site Director
### Who are they?
The Site Director is positioned between Level 4 and the O5 Council. The Site Director can be seen as an intern O5 Council member, who works directly below the O5 Council to acquire more in-depth knowledge of the Foundation's operations and push the Foundation forward in an attempt to join the O5 Council itself.

### What are their responsibilities?
- Works with the Foundation's High Command in order to make the best/improve choices and implementations.
- Processing of community suggestions, liaising with other parties within the Foundation where applicable.
- Gathering the general perception of the Foundation experience from the perspectives of others in order to adapt systems and ideas where necessary.
- Offering advice and guidance to anyone who may need it.
- Addressing concerns and questions Foundation members may have.
- Takes on part of the responsibility in ensuring all Foundation operations run smoothly.
- Taking initiative in order to push the Foundation forward.
- The hosting of tours for members who are curious as to what our facilities hold and/or want to learn more about the Foundation.
- The organisation of on-site drills to ensure members are on their toes and ready to respond, and to also assess their performance.
- The carrying out of tests/check-ups to aid the Scientific Department and Medical Department in their duties.
- The hosting of bi-weekly command meetings. These have two segments - one for High Command, and one for Medium and High Command. There is no defined time limit for these segments or the meeting altogether. Meetings are to be hosted via a hybrid of in-game text and voice chat. In addition, a recording must be taken so those who were not in attendance may know what was discussed. There must be opportunities for the following.
    - Raise concerns.
    - Answer questions.
    - Gather and comment on feedback.
    - Raise and pertinent suggestions.
    - State any recent notices/changes.
    - Bring up any other relevant information.

### How long is their term?
The period of which the Site Director shall remain in their position is undefined. It is up to the Council to ensure constant evaluations are being performed. When a Council member feels like it's time to decide on the Site Director's future, they may put forward a vote. During this time, an internal discussion shall be sparked in which Council members may share their thoughts and feelings. When the vote has concluded, either the Site Director shall receive a formal invitation to the Council, remain at their current position for further evaluation, or be dismissed. Dismissal results in them moving back to Level 4, returning to the department they came from prior to their elevation to Site Director.

### How are they selected?
Site Directors are selected based on a "Single Transferable Vote" system, in which all Foundation members (although generally not the O5 Council) may participate if they wish to do so. This means there will be rounds of elections (each lasting two days) until a candidate receives more than 50% of votes, in which this candidate shall be named the new Site Director. After a round has concluded, the candidate with the least votes shall be withdrawn from the overall election. Members who voted for this candidate are now expected to vote for another candidate in the upcoming election round. It should be noted, however, that if only one candidate is running, they will, by default, become the next Site Director. At any one time, there may only be one Site Director.

Only Level 4 members are eligible to become a candidate. In order to become one, a brief is to be submitted containing what they wish to accomplish during their Site Director term, in the form of bullet points, along with a short and concise justification. These briefs are to be completely anonymous. A short introduction and conclusion may be added as well if the candidate wishes.

In the event of the Site Director's dismissal, they cannot run in the direct upcoming election. This is to ensure the position is able to be granted to others.

### What happens with an elected Site Director's Level 4 position?
When a Level 4 is elevated to the Site Director position, a temporary Level 4 shall be instated from their department's Level 3 members (whose position will not be refilled until the future for the elected Site Director has been sealed). If the Site Director is moved into the Council, this temporary Level 4 shall become permanent. In the case the Site Director is dismissed, then this temporary Level 4 will be moved back to Level 3.

## Technical Site Director
### Who are they?
The Technical Site Director is also positioned between Level 4 and the O5 Council, like the Site Director. Rather than focusing on the managerial side of the Foundation though, they instead focus on the technical side - this being the content that the Manufacturing Department produces. While the O5 Council still holds control over the Manufacturing Department, it is safe to say the Technical Site Director can be considered the equivalent of an "Overseer" in this respect.

### What are their responsibilities?
- Processing of technical community suggestions, liaising with other parties within the Foundation where applicable.
- Taking initiative in order to push the Foundation forward on a developmental level.
- Responsible for the Foundationâ€™s facilities and leading the Manufacturing Department effectively to ensure all sites, areas, and zones are properly sustained.

### How long is their term?
The Technical Site Director term is indefinite. Those who are appointed remain at their position until they are either dismissed, transferred, or resign.

### How are they selected?
The Technical Site Director is selected based on various factors, including but not limited to the following.

- Loyalty towards the Foundation.
- The dedication they are willing to put into their role.
- The knowledge they possess in all fields of development.
- Their vision for the Foundation.

The Technical Site Director may only be appointed by The Administrator in cooperation with the Overseeing Foreperson, with assistance from the O5 Council where applicable.

### Are there any possibilities for promotion?
Usually, there is no possible route of promotion from this position directly within the Foundation. This is to ensure a majority of the Technical Site Director's focus and priorities remain within the boundaries of development.
