# Overseer Council
The Overseer Council consists of O5 Council members. Members oversee one or more departments to ensure they are functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible. That's not to say they cannot focus on other areas of the Foundation, however.

The Overseer Council may alternatively be referred to as the "Council" or the "O5 Council".

Also part of the Overseer Council is the “Overseeing Foreperson” (who can also be recognised as the “Overseeing Foreman” or “Overseeing Forewoman” depending on the gender they identify themselves as). The responsibility of the Overseeing Foreperson is to guide and coordinate members of the O5 Council to ensure the best possible decisions are being made and processes are being fully thought out with care and consideration. Typically, the Overseeing Foreperson must remain unbiased, however, is allowed to give their input and opinions where appropriate.

Some of the Overseer Council's duties include the following.

- Responsible for ensuring the Foundation is actively progressing and reaching new highs.
- Implements high-level systems that are deemed to be of benefit to the Foundation.
- Conduct regular meetings in order to raise any issues which the Foundation is facing. During said meeting, solutions will be discussed.
- Looking over Level 4 and other Foundation members to share their knowledge and guide them on a path to success, also handling any concerns and queries they may have.
- Maintain operational integrity, availability, and confidentiality when it comes down to maintaining the Foundation and its assets.
- Discuss appeals from members, with the possibility of said appeals being approved.
