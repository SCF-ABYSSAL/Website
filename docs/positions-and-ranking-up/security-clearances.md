# Security Clearances / Levels
In order to promote organisation within the Foundation, each member is assigned a security clearance (also known as a “level”) that determines what they have access to, such as site areas and what privileges are granted.

## Level 0
This security clearance is granted to entry-level members, meaning this will be the first security clearance members will obtain when becoming a member of the Foundation. Class D players may apply for Level 0 by following the steps outlined in the [Joining the Foundation](/home/joining.html) page.

Members of this security clearance are expected to observe on-site activities to gain a basic understanding of Foundation operations. Doing so will hopefully spark inspiration to join a preferred department (when achieved Level 1) allowing for further advancement within the Foundation.

## Level 1
This security clearance is granted to novice members. It is the first security clearance which allows members of the Foundation to start applying for (and if successful, join) departments.

Like Level 0, to become Level 1 an application must be submitted within the Foundation’s [Application Center](https://www.roblox.com/games/751327351).

Members of this security clearance are expected to explore more in-depth as to what departments they would like to join and become integrated within one. This will significantly boost the chances of progression within the Foundation, especially when applying for Level 2.

## Level 2
This security clearance is granted to more experienced members of the community, usually those who are well-integrated into the departments they have decided to join. In some departments, this rank is considered “Medium Command” for said department, allowing for leadership and managerial skills to start being demonstrated and built upon.

Like Level 0 and Level 1, to become Level 2 an application must be submitted within the Foundation’s [Application Center](https://www.roblox.com/games/751327351).

Members will remain at this security clearance until a department’s Leadership Team has deemed the member in question has built the necessary skills and talents to join the department’s High Command.

## Level 3
This security clearance is granted to members of the Foundation who have demonstrated they have the necessary skills and talents to join a department’s “High Command”, and are subsequently considered “second-in-command” of the said department.

Members who hold this security clearance are considered to be part of the Foundation’s overall Medium Command allowing for them to provide more input in terms of guiding the Foundation in the best possible direction as well as handling some managerial tasks.

Unlike Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2, this security clearance cannot be applied for. Instead, members are hand-picked to be assigned this security clearance by a department’s Leadership Team, in cooperation with the department’s Overseer.

## Level 4
This security clearance is granted to department heads, also known as a departmental “first-in-command” or  part of its “Leadership Team”. Members of this security clearance have demonstrated extensive knowledge in regards to their department, and have shown strong indicators they possess the necessary skills and talents to steer the department in the right direction for the community.

Members who hold this security clearance are considered to be part of the Foundation’s overall High Command allowing for them to provide an even greater amount of input in terms of guiding the Foundation in the best possible direction as possible. Level 4 members hold many more managerial duties in comparison to Level 3 also, to ensure the proper and efficient functioning of the Foundation.

Like Level 3, this security clearance cannot be applied for. Instead, members are hand-picked to be assigned this security clearance by a department’s Overseer.

Site Directors are also given this security clearance, although they are part of the Overwatch Command too. For more information on Site Directors and the Overwatch Command, please see [this page](/positions-and-ranking-up/chain-of-command/overwatch-command.html).

## O5 Council
This security clearance is granted to Overseers of the Foundation, also known as the “Overseer Council”, “O5 Council”, or “Council”. Members of this security clearance have demonstrated extraordinary skills and talents, both in terms of leadership and management. They are also very knowledgeable individuals who are ready to adapt to environments and solve problems which may face them.

Like Level 3 and Level 4, this position cannot be applied for. Instead, potential members must first become the Site Director via the appropriate [election process](/positions-and-ranking-up/chain-of-command/overwatch-command.html#how-are-they-selected). Upon the O5 Council being happy with the performance the elected Site Director has demonstrated via a Council majority vote and discussion, the Site Director will be invited to join the Council.
