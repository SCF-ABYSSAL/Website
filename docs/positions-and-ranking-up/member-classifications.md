# Member Classifications
Like security clearances, members are placed into “member classifications” based on a set of criteria being met. These classifications are based on a mixture of positioning and joined departments. They are not possible to be applied for but are rather automatically assigned.

Member classifications are primarily used to determine whose security must be prioritised from a strategic perspective, however may also be used to distinguish a set of members for convenience.

The member classifications are as follows.

- **Class A** - Granted to members part of the Overwatch Command and O5 Council.
- **Class B** - Granted to members who are part of at least one department.
- **Class C** - Granted to members who hold a security clearance of at least Level 0, but are not part of a department.
- **Class D** - Granted to regular test subjects who participate in on-site activities.
- **Class E** - Granted to suspended members (this will be the member’s sole classification for the duration of the suspension).

The importance of members can be comprehended alphabetically; Class A members are more strategically important than Class E members.
