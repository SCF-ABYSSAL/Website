# Donating
Patreon is a platform that allows us to accept donations. By doing so, it allows members of the community to show their appreciation of the work that goes into making what we provide. As we grow, so do our expenses. By aiding us, you help guarantee we can continue to evolve within the genre. Besides gaining the satisfaction of helping a Foundation you believe in, a limited number of donator packages are available per month. By donating for a package, it makes you eligible for some free perks.

## How to Donate
Donating is simple! Just head over to [https://www.patreon.com/itamarmadar](https://www.patreon.com/itamarmadar), select the tier you'd like to donate for and follow the instructions displayed.

## The Claiming Process
### Notification
In this stage, this is where you notify us that you've donated via Patreon. Please ensure to include the necessary relevant information (which can be found in the template above), otherwise, we will be unable to grant you your free perks. It can take up to **24 hours** for your email to be read due to the number of requests we need to handle, however, we do strive to serve you as quickly as possible.

### Verification
In order to ensure you have donated to us via Patreon, we need to check that the Patreon email you provided us with exists in our records. This stage can take up to **36 hours**.

### Invitation
Once we have verified your donation tier, we will go ahead and invite you to the **Office of The Administrator Discord server**. Upon joining, you will be asked to read through the channels that are provided to you to ensure you understand what is expected. Go ahead and email us back once you have done so, so the **Application stage** can commence.

### Application
At this stage, your Discord tags and free Patreon perks are applied to your account - this can take up to **24 hours** from the point you sent a reply to us (see Invitation stage). Perks will be applied on new **servers only**.

## Best Time to Donate
Due to the way Patreon works in conjunction with our internal systems, Patrons only keep their free perks until the end of the calendar month. At the end of the calendar month, assuming you're still a subscribed Patron, you will get charged again to continue the subscription for the duration of the new calendar month. As a result, we highly recommend **subscribing at the start of the new calendar month** to maximise the amount of time you get your free perks.

## New Patrons (1st - 4th)
*This section does not apply to Patrons who are continuing their subscription from the previous month.*

If you're donating between the **1st** and the **4th** of the calendar month, there will be a delay for the **Verification** stage for **new Patrons**. This is because, during this period, Patreon is still clearing payments. At the end of the 4th, this delay is completely eliminated as new Patrons are processed in a large batch. Everything onwards should be smooth sailing.

## Disclaimers
- You are responsible for any infractions issued towards yourself. If you are held accountable for a wrong-doing, you may still have your game access or other services restricted.
- If you have committed an infraction, depending on the severity, we reserve the right to remove your Patreon perks, with or without notice.
