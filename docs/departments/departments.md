# Departments
There are two classifications of departments within the Foundation, referred to as "Department Classification". These are as follows.

- Major
- Minor

Members are permitted to be in two departments at any one time. These may consist of one major and one minor, or two minors. This is to ensure members do not become overwhelmed with duties from the departments they are part of.

While Level 3 are allowed in multiple departments, they may only be part of one departmental High Command.

Foundation High Command members are only permitted to be in the department they lead unless an exemption has been granted by the O5 Council.

- Associate Researcher
- Researcher
- Senior Researcher (Level 3)
- Chief Researcher (Level 4)

### Description
The Scientific Department, also abbreviated as ScD, researches, and experiments on the anomalous entities held by the Foundation itself known as SCPs. The Scientific Department has always been deemed the heart of this fantastic organization. Each rank, no matter what status, contributes to the countless findings made each day while examining these SCPs contained on-site. Maturity, intelligence, and creativity are expected of all Scientific members.

Being a member of the Scientific Department allows the scientist to take part in many new, intriguing activities such as group testing, cross-testing, and object-testing. Testing SCPs is what fuels the Scientific Department in the long run, which keeps many members active as they test on new, undiscovered entities.

Currently, the only way to achieve a position in the Scientific Department is to fill out an application as a Level 1 or Level 2 member. Both Chief Researchers carefully review applications every single day to accept new members into the Scientific Department. Once a member has entered the department after being accepted, they notice that they have acquired the role of “Entrant”, the lowest rank in the Scientific Department.

To rank up, members need to submit multiple testing reports. The reports are letter-graded using a rubric from A to D, with the possibility of plus (+) variant grades. Promotions are based on the number of points you acquire in your journey throughout the Scientific Department. Senior Researchers take part in grading reports, as well as other activities such as supervision and tests.

Professionalism, maturity, a good understanding of the rules and regulations, and, of course, wit is expected and needed for those who are part of the Mobile Task Forces, as well as for those who wish to try out for it sometime in the future. Tryouts are held whenever the department requires more members to operate properly.

Mobile Task Forces members are commonly seen guarding members or locations of interest for foreign and opposing forces. This includes all members with a clearance of Level 4 or higher, as well as throughout the Containment Zones. Mobile Task Forces operatives should possess above-average combat skills so that they may perform their duties guarding the aforementioned items properly. Training is held often to ensure that Mobile Task Forces members do not lose their combat or containment skills and strict guidelines are put into place to avoid any and all mishaps from happening.

Every Task Force has a Captain who reports to the Field Chiefs, whilst the latter report directly to the Overseer. Mobile Task Forces members also play an essential role in countering all attacks, direct or indirect, made by Groups of Interest and ensure that no SCP's or Class D/E members are breached. The department has its own special protocols and codenames in order to make its operations more efficient, which all members are required to know about.

Being a part of the Medical Department grants members the availability to perform various types of medical checkups on all members working in the facility, ranging from Class D members to members of the O5 Council.

Members of the rank “Practitioner” gain the ability to host experiments on various SCP’s to learn about their medical qualities, with each rank allowing more testing opportunities than the previous. At these ranks, medical members also work closely with members of the Scientific Department, utilizing various medical vials with different effects to assist researchers in their experiments.

To rank up, members are required to conduct medical checkups, tests, and assistance that are of adequate quality. For each, a report will need to be generated.

The Engineering & Technical Services is a department tasked with the upkeep of the various systems which allow Foundation sites to remain a safe and liveable work environment. From broken light fixtures to reactor core meltdowns and anything in between, the Engineering & Technical Services is there to repair it all. On top of this, the department works together with the Manufacturing Department to create new, well-designed containment and observation chambers.

New members within the department are of the title "Apprentice Technician". While members of this rank have still a way to go when it comes to repairing on-site systems and equipment, there is still plenty to enjoy, such as conducting containment revisions to keep the standards of containment up-to-scratch and repairing the Test Subject Cells observation glass to ensure the insides of the facility remain safe from Class D.

Those who are a "Technician" have a solid foundation of knowledge, although their learning doesn't end here. They have mastered the workings of basic systems and equipment, but now comes the chance to learn about more complex operations. Technicians are able to repair hostile tunnels after raids to aid the Mobile Task Forces in securing the site. In addition, they can repair turbines to ensure the site doesn't lose power.

All-in-all, the efforts of the Engineering & Technical Services are essential in order to maintain the safety and integrity of Foundation sites.

The Manufacturing Department is responsible for the development of the games, services, and systems we provide. They are masterminds when it comes down to development, spanning across several fields within the industry. Some examples include building, modelling, and scripting.

When a developer gets approved into the Manufacturing Department, they will be of the rank "Probationary Developer". This is essentially a trial rank where a developer can show their skills and talents to the command team. After successfully completing several tasks, Probationary Developers will be promoted to Junior Developer.

Junior Developers are those who have shown their skills and talents but are still learning within their chosen fields. Only when they have demonstrated they are strong within their chosen fields will they be promoted to Developer.

Senior Developers are those who have accumulated a lot of knowledge in their chosen fields and actively go out of their way to help Probationary and Junior developers with any questions or issues they may have. Senior Developers can be seen as being part of the Manufacturing Department's command team, albeit not Second in Command. They are regularly called upon to assess the feasibility of a new implementation or to lead a project the team is currently working on.

It should be noted that although Contractors and QA Testers are associated with the Manufacturing Department, they are not direct members. Contractors are members who we hire for one-off or specific tasks. QA Testers are hand-picked members of the community who test pre-release versions of our games and updates. They are not able to progress unless they submit an Expression of Interest.
