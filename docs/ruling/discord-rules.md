# Discord Rules
If it's your first time visiting our services, we welcome you. We're glad to have you here. In order to have a safe and fun environment, there are some rules that you need to be aware of. They are designed to allow freedom, but to an extent that ensures content is suitable for our audience.

In the event one of the outlined rules is broken and depending on the severity of your offense, action will be taken. This can either be a warning, a mute, or a ban. If necessary, the O5 Council may authorise a blacklist from all our services too.

The punishment flows outlined are a reference as to the sort of punishments to expect for each infraction of a rule. By default, they are to be followed. As by nature, punishment flows cannot take into account the severity, details, and consequences of all cases, therefore, incidents may be referred to or intervened by the O5 Council to determine an adequate punishment to be issued in replacement to the outlined punishment flow.

## Application
The application of the rules outlined in the article applies to **all of our services**, where such a rule allows for it. For example, if we use the rule "bypassing the chat filter system is prohibited", then this means where there is a chat filter then it mustn't be bypassed.

Generally, we refer to Discord as a baseline set of rules for all our services due to the fact it gives us a good foundation to extend off of. We align with the principles of Discord, but also go further in some areas to ensure the comfort and safety of the community is upheld.

***Within this section, the term “Content” refers to any form of media that can be shared or viewed with/by others, including, but not limited to:** Graphics, Animations, Emotes, Avatars, Text, Links, Audio.*
