# Appeals
We take appeals very seriously, so we expect you to do the same. Appeals are a chance for your punishment to be lifted, so ensure you are creating appeals that show us you are worthy to be unpunished.

**We do not accept appeals for users who have exploited, however, feel free to send an appeal regardless, if you would like the case reviewed.**

## Creating an Appeal
In order to create an appeal, the below template needs to be filled in first. The template we provide is the minimum we expect, but do feel free to add on to it. Doing so will increase your chances of the appeal being accepted.

```
Roblox Username:
Discord Username (e.g. Wumpus#1234):
Intent: <Blacklist / Application Centre / Site-17 / Site-19 / Area-14 / Discord>
Why were you punished?:
Why do you wish to be unpunished?:
Why should we trust you not to commit a similar offence in the future?:
```

## Process
### Submission
Firstly, the appeal needs to be sent to us. Once the above template has been filled in, please email us at **support@scpf.team**, as well as providing us with your appeal.

### Review
Once we have received your appeal, a support representative will forward it to the appropriate parties. This always includes the Council. A discussion will then take place with said parties, resulting in a conclusion being drawn via a Council majority vote. This stage usually takes up to **72 hours**.

### Conclusion
Once a Council conclusion has been reached, we will reach out stating if the appeal was successful or not. If the appeal was unsuccessful, we will provide a reason so you can improve for your next appeal (if you decide you'd like to submit one).

### Cooldown
From the point of receiving a conclusion as a result of submitting an appeal, there is a **two-week cooldown** before you can submit another. This is employed to ensure members are putting effort into their appeals, rather than continuously sending the same or similar appeal over and over again. When submitting another appeal, we expect it to be different from any of your previous appeals, taking into consideration the feedback we gave at the concluding stages.
