# Reporting Users
In order to report a user, simply execute the "**-report**" command inside **#unrelated_communications** of the main Discord server. Please ensure you have photographic evidence, as otherwise, we cannot take action against the rule breaker. If it's a voice-related incident, please contact Level 4 as soon as possible, with evidence, if possible.

## Incidents Outside Our Services
Due to the difficulty and privacy implications of us investigating incidents that take place outside our services, we may or may not be able to act depending on the relationship between the parties involved.

### No relation
If there is no prior relationship between the parties involved, here we would be able to act. Environments that would constitute "No Relation" include the following.

- No prior messages from yourself to the other party.
- Purely basic questions or statements from yourself, such as asking for clarification on our guideline articles or responding in a minimalistic manner (yes, no, maybe, thank you, etc).
- Purely Foundation-based activities, such as working together to work on implementing a new department system.

In order for the Foundation to act on the user, you must notify a member in one of the following parties of the incident.

- O5 Council

Once you have sent the notification, you should hear back soon, usually within 24 hours - we aim for it as soon as possible, however. This is where an investigation will be started to evaluate your claim. During the investigation, the following will occur.

- You will be asked to provide more details on the event, such as when it occurred, the user's username, and an overview of what happened.
- You will be asked to attend a Discord screen share session to validate the claim (which will get recorded by the investigator to be stored as evidence), where you will be requested to:
- Browse through your recent messages (after a page reload) with the user so context can be gained.
- Display the unique identifier of the user's account e.g. Discord Snowflake.
- You will be provided with guidance on what you should do next, usually, blocking the user in question.

After the investigation has concluded, the evidence will be discussed within the investigator's team, and if applicable, action will be taken. You will be updated regardless if action is taken or not, as well as be provided with reasoning.

### Prior or Existing Relation
If you do not fit in the [No Relation](#no-relation) category, then this typically means you have had or have an on-going relationship with the other party, such as a friendship or other form. Unfortunately, due to such environments being very likely to contain personal information, we are unable to act - we are, however, here to support you. You are free to reach out to anyone, bypassing the chain of command if you wish.

For matters where you feel threatened, upset, or disturbed, we highly recommend you follow the below steps so the user(s) in question can be handled accordingly by professionals.

- Gather information regarding the incident. This includes images, recordings, channel identifications, message identifications, and user identifications. The more information you gather regarding the incident, the easier it will be for the appropriate professionals to investigate.
- Block the user(s) in question, and most importantly, do not speak to them any further. Adding "fuel to the fire" or even acknowledging your presence will make them continue. Your reaction is what makes incidents continue. Without a reaction, the user(s) will eventually tire and give up.
- Report the user(s) to the service provider (e.g. Discord), providing the information you have gathered on the incident. Although they'll still need to investigate, it'll make their job easier and an outcome will be reached much sooner.
- If you feel it's necessary, report the user(s) to your local law enforcement body. The reporting process varies greatly between countries, however, many law enforcement bodies have details on their website as to how you can report cases.

## Intelligence Agency
If your report falls under any of the below categories, it is requested you contact a member of the Intelligence Agency immediately. These members can be identified within the main Discord as they have an "Intelligence Agency" tag.

- Abuse of Power
- Suspicious Activity
- Information Breaches

### Information Breaches
Should you come across an information breach, or should anyone breach classified information to you, it is **mandatory** that you report the breach to any Intelligence Agency member **immediately**, prioritising members who are online. Failure to do so will classify you as a violator, inevitably resulting in punishment. Itâ€™s essential that you provide details as specific as possible in order to avoid confusion. Make sure you are direct, provide evidence, and explain the situation as best as you can.

After you have reported the situation, make sure to inform someone who holds a Level 4 clearance or above, so they can remove the user(s) from the required Discord servers if necessary.

If you come across an information breach, you are not permitted to mention said breach or the information linked to it to anyone that is not part of the Intelligence Agency, or does not hold a Level 4 (Level 5 if the information breach is above Level 4) clearance. Doing so will classify you as a violator.

## Urgent Matters
If your report falls under any of the below categories, it is requested you please email **management@scpf.team** immediately. Please use the prefix "[URGENT]" in the title of your email.
