# Game Rules
In order to dissuade those within the community from breaking the rules, from time-to-time, we may need to take action on rule breakers. Our in-game rules apply across all our games, not exclusively to Area-14.

Depending on the severity and incident, additional or modifications to the below-outlined violations may be employed. These are just a baseline and are what we generally issue when it comes down to the stated scenarios.

Only Level 4+ or other members in a judicial position have permission to issue moderation action against a player.

Violation of any of the following rules will result in disciplinary action being taken.

- **Exploiting** (behaving in a manner that is not natural to the default Roblox client) - Permanent ban.
- **Exploiter Styled** (having the style of a typical exploiter, meeting all of the following: random jumbled username, default appearance, rejoining quickly after a prior account was banned) - Permanent ban.
- **Ban Evading** (using an alternative account to bypass an on-going ban) - Permanent ban.
- **Repeated Violations** (punishments have failed in rectifying behaviour, internal thresholds have been exceeded) - Permanent ban.
- **Rogue** (major breach of the guidelines that have been set out) - 3-day ban and a demotion to Class D.
- **Glitching** (making use of bugs/systems which are not intended) - 3-day ban.
- **Wall Shooting** (shooting through a solid object) - 3-day ban.
- **Violating Roblox Terms of Service** (not abiding by the terms Roblox have set - an exclusion to this is when players use language not directed at others) - 1-day ban.
- **Evading Solitary Confinement** (avoiding solitary confinement) - 1-day ban.
- **Spawn Killing** (killing in a spawn room or as members exit) - 1-day ban.
