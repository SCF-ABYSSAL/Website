# Inactivity Notices
Every now and again, you may need to go inactive for various reasons, such as going on holiday or not having access to a PC. Inactivity notices only need to be submitted if you are away longer than 36 hours. Please refer to your department guidelines as there may be further regulations in regards to inactivity notices. You will receive a direct message via Discord when your inactivity notice has been approved/declined.

## Criteria

- Level 3 needs to submit an inactivity notice 48 hours ahead of time.
- Level 4 and above need to submit an inactivity notice 72 hours ahead of time.
